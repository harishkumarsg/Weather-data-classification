# Weather-data-classification
This project focuses on classifying weather data using a Decision Tree Classifier in Scikit-learn. The goal is to predict weather conditions, such as sunny, rainy, or snowy, based on features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
